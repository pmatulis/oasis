### The practice

The practice consists of specific but gentle exercises. Their main objectives
are to:

* open the joints
* lengthen the sinews
* strengthen the muscles (legs, back, core)
* improve posture
* develop coordination
* foster bodily awareness

Long-term practitioners have reported additional benefits such as a better
quality of sleep, enhanced mental acuity, and a softening of the heart.

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and sometimes on the floor. The
movements are slow and sedate. They can be adapted according to the needs of
each student.

Various aspects of the exercises are highlighted as a student's capacity to
understand them deepens over time. Everyone engages in the same essential
practice however.

Gradually, movements are stitched together, thereby enabling a single longer
move to be practised. To the untrained eye, this "form" manifests as classical
tai chi. Indeed, the founding teacher (Mr. Moy) chose traditional Yang style
for the choreography of his internal art.

For more information on the origins of these teachings see the [main lineage
web site](https://taichinuances.com).

### The environment

The teacher shares their experience and the students practice in a
non-competitive environment. Teacher and student often practice together.
Everything takes place in a convivial, unhurried, and informal atmosphere.

Participants are encouraged to dispense with their shoes (the space is cleaned
beforehand).

There will be a short break where herbal tea is served.
