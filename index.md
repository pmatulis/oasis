## Welcome

Oasis Internal Arts offers classes in Chinese healing arts. Its mission is to
serve as an oasis for the traveller of the modern world.

### The environment

The environment is non-competitive where people of all ages, genders, colours,
shapes, and sizes are welcome.

The practice space is cleaned before each class and participants are encouraged
to dispense with their shoes.

There will be a short non-caffeinated drink break (e.g. herbal tea).

### The practice

The practice consists of specific but gentle exercises. Their goals are to:

* open the joints
* lengthen the sinews
* strengthen the muscles (legs, back, core)
* improve posture
* develop coordination
* foster bodily awareness

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and sometimes on the floor. The
movements taught are slow and sedate.

As a student progresses, exercises evolve from basic to subtle. They deepen as
a student's capacity to receive them deepens. However, everyone engages in the
same essential practice. Long-term practitioners have reported additional
benefits such as improved sleep, mental acuity, and open-heartedness.

To the untrained eye, the form executed on two feet manifests as classical tai
chi. Indeed, the founding teacher (Mr. Moy) chose traditional Yang style as the
choreography of his internal art.

For more information on the origins of these teachings see the [main lineage
