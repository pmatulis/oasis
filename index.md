## Welcome

Pointe Claire Internal Arts offers classes in Chinese-based healing arts. Its
mission is to act as an oasis for the weary traveller of the modern world.

### The environment

The practice space is cleaned before each class and participants are encouraged
to dispense with their outdoor shoes.

The environment is non-competitive and emotionally safe. People of all ages,
genders, colours, shapes, and sizes are welcome.

There will be a short non-caffeinated drink break (e.g. herbal tea).

### The practice

The practice consists of very specific exercises. Its goals are to:

* open the joints
* lengthen the sinews
* strengthen the muscles (legs, back, core)
* improve posture
* develop bodily awareness (coordination)

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and sometimes on the floor. The
movements taught are slow and sedate.

As a student progresses, these exercises evolve from gentle to more demanding.
However, wherever any given student may be, everyone does the same essential
practice. The exercises only deepen as a student's capacity to receive them
deepen.

Seen from afar, when done standing (on two feet), the practice can be said to
be like tai chi. Indeed, the founding teacher (Mr. Moy) chose to use the
traditional Yang style tai chi as the receptacle for his art.

### What you will need

* loose clothing
* a yoga mat or a blanket
* thick socks (or double socks)
* your full attention

Avoid a big meal prior to class.

### Teacher

Peter Matulis (PCIA head instructor) has been practising a modern expression of
yiquan since 1991. He is also familiar with traditional tai chi (Chen village)
after having practised it for eight years (2012 - 2020). Chen tai chi however
is not taught.
