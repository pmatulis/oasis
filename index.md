### The practice

The practice consists of exercises that are done standing, in a chair, and
sometimes on the floor. They are primarily done as movements but they can also
be stationary (static postures). They all have as objectives to:

* open the joints
* lengthen the sinews
* strengthen the muscles (legs, back, core)
* improve posture
* develop coordination
* foster bodily awareness

Long-term practitioners have reported additional benefits such as a better
quality of sleep, enhanced mental acuity, and a softening of the heart.

The static postures can be experienced as standing meditation (zhan zhuang).

The moving exercises are slow and sedate. They are stitched together, thereby
enabling a single longer move to be practised. To the untrained eye, this
"form" manifests as classical tai chi. Indeed, the founding teacher (Mr. Moy)
chose traditional Yang style for the choreography of his internal art.

Various aspects of the exercises are highlighted as a student's capacity to
understand them deepens over time. Everyone engages in the same essential
practice however. **All the instructions can be adapted according to the needs
of each student.**

For more information on the origins of these teachings see the [Tai Chi
Nuances](https://taichinuances.com) website.
