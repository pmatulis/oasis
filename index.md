## Welcome

Pointe-Claire Internal Arts offers classes in Chinese-based healing arts. Its
mission is to act as an oasis for the weary traveller of the modern world.

### The environment

The practice space is cleaned before each class and participants are encouraged
to dispense with their outdoor shoes.

The environment is non-competitive and emotionally safe. People of all ages,
genders, colours, shapes, and sizes are welcome.

There will be a short non-caffeinated drink break (e.g. herbal tea).

### The practice

The practice consists of specific but gentle exercises. Their goals are to:

* open the joints
* lengthen the sinews
* strengthen the muscles (legs, back, core)
* improve posture
* develop coordination

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and sometimes on the floor. The
movements taught are slow and sedate.

As a student progresses, these exercises evolve from basic to subtle. They
deepen as a student's capacity to receive them deepens. However, everyone
engages in the same essential practice. Long-term practitioners have reported
indirect benefits such as calmness, mental alertness, and generosity.

To the untrained eye, when executing the "form" on two feet, the practice takes
on the appearance of typical tai chi. Indeed, the founding teacher (Mr. Moy)
chose to use traditional Yang style tai chi as the receptacle for his internal
art.

For more information on the origins of these teachings see the [main lineage
web site](https://taichinuances.com/).

### What you will need

* loose clothing
* a yoga mat or a blanket
* thick socks (or double socks)
* your full attention

Avoid a big meal prior to class.

### Teacher

Peter Matulis (PCIA head instructor) has been practising a modern expression of
yiquan since 1991. He is also familiar with the other end of the spectrum: a
very traditional tai chi (Chen village) - having practised it for eight
years (2012 - 2020). Chen tai chi however is not taught.
