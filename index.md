## Welcome

Pointe Claire Internal Arts offers classes in Chinese-based health arts. Its mission is to act as an oasis for the weary traveler of the modern world. 

### The practice

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and on the floor. The space is cleaned before each class and participants are encouraged to dispense with their outdoor shoes.

The practice:

- takes place in a non-competitive and emotionally safe environment
- is welcoming to people of all ages, genders, colours, shapes, and sizes
- can be adapted in terms of rigour on a per-student basis
- recognises the inseparability of body and mind
- is fun

There will be a (herbal) tea break!

### What you will need

- loose clothing
- a yoga mat or a blanket
- thick socks (or double socks)
- your full attention

Avoid a big meal prior to class.

### Teacher

Peter Matulis has been practicing a modern expression of yiquan since 1991. He has also been practicing Chen's tai chi since 2012. He places an emphasis on the fundamental aspects of these arts and on their meditative character.
