## Welcome

Pointe Claire Internal Arts offers classes in Chinese-based health arts. Its mission is to act as an oasis for the weary traveler of the modern world. 

### The practice

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and on the floor. The space is cleaned before each class and participants are encouraged to wear soft footwear such as thick socks.

The practice:

- takes place in a non-competitive and emotionally safe environment
- is welcoming and adaptable to people of all ages, genders, colours, shapes, and sizes
- recognises the inseparability of body and mind
- is fun

There will be a herbal tea break!

### What you will need

- your full attention
- loose clothing
- a yoga mat or a blanket 

* Avoid a big meal prior to class.
