## Welcome

Oasis Internal Arts offers classes in the Chinese healing arts. Its mission is
to serve as an oasis for the traveller of the modern world. People of all ages,
genders, colours, and shapes are welcome here.

### The environment

The teacher shares their experience and the students practice in a
non-competitive environment. Teacher and student often practice together.
Everything takes place in a convivial, unhurried, and informal atmosphere.

Participants are encouraged to dispense with their shoes (the space is cleaned
beforehand).

There will be a short break where herbal tea is served.

### The practice

The practice consists of specific but gentle exercises. Their main objectives
are to:

* open the joints
* lengthen the sinews
* strengthen the muscles (legs, back, core)
* improve posture
* develop coordination
* foster bodily awareness

Long-term practitioners have reported additional benefits such as a better
quality of sleep, enhanced mental acuity, and a softening of the heart.

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and sometimes on the floor. The
movements are slow and sedate. They can be adapted according to the needs of
each student.

Various aspects of the exercises are highlighted as a student's capacity to
understand them deepens over time. Everyone engages in the same essential
practice however.

Gradually, movements are stitched together like a puzzle. This enables a single
longer move to be practised (fun). To the untrained eye, this "form" manifests
as classical tai chi. The founding teacher (Mr. Moy) chose traditional Yang
style as the external container for his internal art.
