## Welcome

Pointe Claire Internal Arts offers classes in Chinese-based healing arts. Its
mission is to act as an oasis for the weary traveller of the modern world.

### The practice

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and sometimes on the floor. The space
is cleaned before each class and participants are encouraged to dispense with
their outdoor shoes.

The practice:

- takes place in a non-competitive and emotionally safe environment
- is welcoming to people of all ages, genders, colours, shapes, and sizes
- can be adapted in terms of rigour on a per-student basis
- recognises the connection between emotions and the body
- is fun

There will be a short non-caffeinated drink break (e.g. herbal tea).

### What you will need

- loose clothing
- a yoga mat or a blanket
- thick socks (or double socks)
- your full attention

Avoid a big meal prior to class.

### Teacher

Peter Matulis has been practising a modern expression of yiquan since 1991. He
is also familiar with Chen village tai chi after having practised it for eight
years (2012 - 2020), however Chen tai chi is not taught. He places an emphasis
on the fundamental aspects of these arts and on their meditative character.
