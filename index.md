## Welcome

Oasis Internal Arts offers classes in the Chinese healing arts. Its mission is
to serve as an oasis for the traveller of the modern world. People of all ages,
genders, colours, and shapes are welcome here. Stay awhile and listen.

### The environment

The teacher shares their experience with students in a non-competitive
environment. Both teacher and students practice together in a convivial
atmosphere of mutual benefit.

The practice space is cleaned before each class and participants are encouraged
to dispense with their shoes.

There will be a short break where herbal tea is served.

### The practice

The practice consists of specific but gentle exercises. Their goals are to:

* open the joints
* lengthen the sinews
* strengthen the muscles (legs, back, core)
* improve posture
* develop coordination
* foster bodily awareness

Long-term practitioners have reported additional benefits such as a higher
quality of sleep, enhanced mental acuity, and open-heartedness.

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and sometimes on the floor. The
movements taught are slow and sedate. They can be adapted according to the
needs of the students.

As a student progresses, aspects of the exercises deepen as a student's
capacity to receive them deepens. However, everyone engages in the same
essential practice.

Very gradually, movements will be stitched together like a puzzle. This will
enable a single longer move to be practised (fun). To the untrained eye, this
"form" manifests as classical tai chi. Indeed, the founding teacher (Mr. Moy)
chose traditional Yang style as the external container for his internal art.

For more information on the origins of these teachings see the [main lineage
