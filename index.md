## Welcome

Pointe-Claire Internal Arts offers classes in Chinese-based healing arts. Its
mission is to act as an oasis for the weary traveller of the modern world.

### The environment

The environment is non-competitive and emotionally safe. People of all ages,
genders, colours, shapes, and sizes are welcome.

The practice space is cleaned before each class and participants are encouraged
to dispense with their shoes.

There will be a short non-caffeinated drink break (e.g. herbal tea).

### The practice

The practice consists of specific but gentle exercises. Their goals are to:

* open the joints
* lengthen the sinews
* strengthen the muscles (legs, back, core)
* improve posture
* develop coordination
* foster bodily awareness

Exercises are done standing, in a chair, and sometimes on the floor. The
movements taught are slow and sedate.

As a student progresses, exercises evolve from basic to subtle. They deepen as
a student's capacity to receive them deepens. However, everyone engages in the
same essential practice. Long-term practitioners have reported indirect
benefits such as calmness, mental acuity, and open-heartedness.

To the untrained eye, the "form" executed on two feet manifests as classical
tai chi. Indeed, the founding teacher (Mr. Moy) chose traditional Yang style
for the choreography (the receptacle) of his internal art.

For more information on the origins of these teachings see the [main lineage
web site](https://taichinuances.com).

### Teacher

Peter Matulis (PCIA head instructor) has been practising a modern expression of
yiquan since 1991. He is also familiar with the other end of the spectrum: a
very traditional tai chi (Chen village) - having practised it for eight
years (2012 - 2020). Chen tai chi however is not taught.
